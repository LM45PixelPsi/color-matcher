# Color-Matcher.App

**Color Matcher** is a free and open-source web app designed to help users create color combinations with adjustable proportions.

The app allows users to **intuitively design color schemes** and easily **share their creations through a simple URL**.

## How It Works & Features

- **3-Color Palette Generation**: Create a palette of three colors, adjusting the size of each color proportionally to achieve the perfect balance.
- **Interactive UI**: Modify colors and proportions in real time with a sleek, minimalistic interface.
- **Color Modes**: Choose from multiple color models, including **HSL**, **HSV**, **CMYK**, and **RGB**.
- **Shareable URL**: Once you've created your color palette, simply copy the URL to share it with others.
- **Fully Responsive**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Wavelength Visualization**: You can visualize colors based on specific wavelengths (in nanometers) to explore how different wavelengths correspond to visible light colors. This mode doesn't support creating palettes but is great for exploring light physics.
- **Open Source**: The app is entirely open-source, enabling developers to contribute or modify it as needed.
